**You may be owed a full refund of your federal student loans.**

**Hereâ€™s how to find out.**

Corinthian Colleges Inc&mdash;which was composed of the Everest, Heald, Wyotech schools&mdash;closed the last of its campuses on April 27th. 


**If you are a student of one of these Corinthian campus that closed on April 27th, you may be eligible to have your federal student loans canceled by applying for a "[closed school discharge](http://www.ifap.ed.gov/dpcletters/attachments/GEN1418AttachLoanDischargeAppSchoolClosure.pdf)."**

* If you were still enrolled on April 27, 2015 then you are eligible for a refund.

      OR

* If you withdrew on or after June 20, 2014 (from a school that closed on April 27, 2015) then you are *also* eligible for a refund.

**TO CLAIM YOUR REFUND, YOU MUST NOT TRANSFER YOUR CREDITS.**


We recommend that you take the [closed school discharge](http://www.ifap.ed.gov/dpcletters/attachments/GEN1418AttachLoanDischargeAppSchoolClosure.pdf) ! Demand your money back! 

**If you transfer even ONE credit to another school, you CANNOT get your money back.**

**The general closed school discharge form link is [here](http://www.ifap.ed.gov/dpcletters/attachments/GEN1418AttachLoanDischargeAppSchoolClosure.pdf).**

When you are done filling out this form, you mail it to your loan servicer.
