If you went to a Heald College between 2010 and 2015, you may qualify for a cancellation of your federal student loans. Unfotunately, [only 180](https://twitter.com/alliebidwell/status/614149753560002560) out of the estimated 40,000 eligible Heald borrowers have filled out this fast-track form to debt relief. 

This is undoubtedly due to the Department of Education's completely inadequate outreach efforts: they have not yet mailed the form to affected borrowers, and the main fillable form is broken on smart phones. It is also entirely within the Department's power to *automatically* provide debt cancellation to the 40,000 Heald students they've decided are eligible for it. And yet they continue to force already-harmed students to jump through hoops in order to obtain relief from the fraud the Department ignored for years. 

In the meantime, the Debt Collective has already spent [extensive effort doing the Department's job for them](http://civichall.org/civicist/what-the-dept-of-education-should-have-done-years-ago/). We ask your help as we continue to do it -- share this page with every Heald student you know. 

###### Went to Heald from 2010-2015? Here's what you need to do in order to apply for debt cancellation:


* Check to see if the Heald program you attended appears on [this list](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/sites/default/files/heald-findings.pdf). If it does, you are eligible to apply.
	* *If your program does not appear on the list, you can still use the Debt Collective's [Dispute Your Debt application](debtcollective.org/corinthiandtr) to apply for debt cancellation*.
* Complete this [fillable PDF form](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/sites/default/files/heald-attestation-form.pdf).
	* Can't open the form on your phone? [Try this version instead](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/sites/default/files/heald-attestation-text-only.html).
* Once you've filled out the form, print it, and sign it. Then, return the signed form to the Department of Education by email (**FSAOperations@ed.gov**) or by mail (**Department of Education, PO Box 194407, San Francisco, CA 94119**)

*NOTE: If you were still enrolled at Heald (or Everest, or Wyotech) when the schools closed on April 27th, 2015, or if you withdrew on or after June 20, 2014, you can get your debt cancelled and any tuition paid refunded through a closed school discharge.
