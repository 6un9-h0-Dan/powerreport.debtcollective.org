In case you missed it, [Susie Cagle published an inspiring comic](http://fusion.net/story/204007/students-ruined-by-for-profit-colleges-fight-back/) about the Debt Collective's efforts to fight back against predatory colleges and the Department of Education. She tells the story of brave strikers from the beginning, describing in vivid pictures how the government funded the scam, how the Debt Collective decided to get involved, and how the Department has so far failed to cancel the fraudulent loans.

Freda: "We aren't whiners and losers. There were a lot of hardworking people who got ripped off -- a lot of mothers, a lot of minorities, and a lot of kids in foster care like me." 


Ann Bowers:

Ann: "They told me I qualified for financial aid -- I thought that meant Pell Grants. I didn't even know I was getting loans."

Ami Schneider:

Pam: "I was basically teaching myself the course curricilum was so easy -- I'd equate it with a 12th grade political science class."
