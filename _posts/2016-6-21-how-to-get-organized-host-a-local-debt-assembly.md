The fight to get debts cancelled for everyone defrauded by predatory schools is heating up. Debt Collective members around the country are talking to their friends and family about the fraudulent for-profit higher education system. Some organizers are hosting small debt assemblies in parks, libraries, and backyards to share details about our campaign with friends and neighbors.
 
In Tennessee last month, three debt strikers held a backyard assembly. They made a banner using the red square - a symbol of debt resistance.

The former Corinthian students also distributed printed materials describing our campaign for debt relief and our upcoming plans.

Debt Collective member and debt striker, Denise, invited several people from her community. They spoke about their struggles with student debt in particular and debt in general.

One attendee did not think she was a good candidate to join the upcoming campaign. At the assembly, she heard other people talking about for-profit colleges. She thought that because she didn't attend a for-profit college, the pain of her student debt wasn't worth sharing. But as we talked, she realized that it wasn't fair that she had to be in so much debt that she couldn't pay just for wanting to get an education--even if she liked her education.

The conversation at the Tennessee assembly eventually moved beyond student debt. Everyone talked about their economic struggles and how hard it was to get older while struggling to make ends meet. 
 
After the event, Denise said, "Some people think you need to have a lot of people to hold a Debt Collective event, but it's not true. It was nice to have a small group. People felt more comfortable talking to each other."
 
Ann B, who helped plan the event, noted that "the most important thing is to let people know that no one should have to go into debt for education and that we can fight back against scam schools and the Department of Education together."

Debt striker Latonya, who helped facilitate the assembly, said, "its important to spread the word that debt strikes work."
