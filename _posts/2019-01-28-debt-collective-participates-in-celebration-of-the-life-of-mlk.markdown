In celebration of the life and work of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., local community organizations, artists, radio stations and groups like the Debt Collective joined together in Leimert Park Village in Los Angeles at the 2019 Freedom Festival. The event was hosted by Council member Marqueece Harris-Dawson office of the City of Los Angeles.

The day was filled with warm weather and music. Friends and family walked around the park to greet and speak with different vendors. Those that stopped at the Debt Collective booth learned how to access free tools for disputing debts that are in collection and errors on credit reports. They also learned how to get support on questions related to student debt. Many passersby gave a warm smile when they read our sign: “You are not a loan”.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. often spoke about economic inequality. In 1966 he worked on the Freedom Budget, which provided a roadmap for wiping out poverty and creating “economic justice for all people in the United States.” While the budget did not pass during his lifetime, the fight for economic justice continues. 

At the Debt Collective, we aim to transform our individual financial struggles into a source of collective power towards realizing Dr. King's vision. As the old saying goes, if you owe the bank $100,000 the bank owns you. But if you owe the bank $100 million, you own the bank. Together, we own the bank.
