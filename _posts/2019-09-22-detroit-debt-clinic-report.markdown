The following is a report from Elia who used our debt dispute tools during recent a debt clinic in Detroit. MI.  If you would like to host a debt clinic, [get in touch](https://community.debtcollective.org/t/organizers-tips-questions-and-brainstorms-for-local-debt-clinics/2674) so we can support you.

Hello! Our event was a smash hit. Our main organizer, Paige, is a major badass so we had tons of community partners/resources there. So, in addition to the debt clinic, we had free food, health screenings, Medicaid sign-up, housing information, etc.



I took the lead on the Debt Clinic and had tons of support from Thomas (I’d @ him but I don’t know his username). I directly helped one woman fight two of her debts which were, of course, incurred by people taking advantage/charging huge interest rates.

Beyond that, I had several productive conversations with people about their debt and walked them through our process/what they had to do to follow-up. It was a little disheartening at first because people are so used to being swindled they asked things like: “What’s the catch?” or “What does this service cost?” I’d keep having to say: “Nothing! We’re socialists and we think these financial institutions are evil. We want to use their own language against them to benefit working people.” Once I explained, the conversation definitely took a more positive turn. One couple even said: “I guess we’re socialists, too.”

At the event, I had several people ask if I could come, just me, to their community space/church to help folks out with debt relief. I told them we’d be doing the event bi-monthly but I also gave them my contact information, and I’m hoping to build some more contacts/do smaller debt clinics throughout Detroit.

Honestly, this was one of my proudest moments as an activist. The event was well-planned, well-attended and actually served the community in a meaningful way. I’m looking forward to continuing my work with the Debt Collective. Thank you so much for this tool and this community.

I’ve also included some pictures from the event.
