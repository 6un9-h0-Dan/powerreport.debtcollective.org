sub-title: But what about when debt is incurred unavoidably, just to stay alive?

If debt were just a matter of numbers, of X owes Y Z, it would be simpler to think about. But it isn't. It's a concept laden and confused with the deepest emotional and religious values of the West.

From day one, we're made to feel there's something shameful about borrowing money. In German, for example, the word *schuld* means both guilt and debt, related to English “should.” We have “owe” and
“ought,” not to mention “redemption;” as if debt were sin, and salvation the final pay-off; as if our soul were a coupon to be redeemed. As Psalm 37 says: The wicked borrow and do not repay.

By extension, that puts the creditor in the position of a powerful god, free to dispense the grace of credit and demand retribution for faithlessness. It's only logical that the sinner atone for her debt with the penance of interest, motivated by guilt and the desire to be relieved. And for the unrepentant to be damned.

That might seem ridiculous, but it isn't far from the truth. People do feel guilty about their debts, apart from any considerations of justice or proportion in the sums involved. Embarrassed to seek help
and powerless to do anything but continue to pay. And maybe, if they only got into debt through irresponsible hedonism, squandering other people's money on their own sordid pleasures and luxuries,
this moralizing scheme would make more sense. But what about when debt is incurred unavoidably, just to stay alive, for things like food or health care emergencies, or for education? Are these luxuries?

What does it mean when people working multiple jobs more than full time cannot get by? And have to charge their groceries, or shoes for their children? When there's no money, but plenty of credit? What
happens when you can't afford the price of your own life? Is that a moral failing?

At issue, I guess, are conflicting views of state and citizen. In one view, the state should serve and safeguard its citizens. This would mean security, healthcare and child care, decent wages and
education, as rights which the government should subsidize or provide. European social democracy style. The other view - put charitably - is that government should get out of the way and do as little as possible, both to and for the citizen. Leave him alone. Supposedly thus, freedom is maximized, which is a different way of serving and safeguarding the citizen. American, free-individual style. A boy and his dog. 

Perhaps in an ideal world. 

But in practice this simply exposes people to neglect and corporate
predation. Mass shootings and incarceration, substandard or no education or health care, NAFTA, the withering of unions, obesity and diabetes. And perhaps the battle is already lost, the necessary result of granting personhood to corporations and making their political donations legally protected free speech.

If corporations are persons, and their freedoms are deregulation and bribery, then what are people, and what will happen to them? The answer is obvious. They'll be compelled deeper and deeper into debt for basic necessities, at higher and higher interest rates. 

“Predatory lending.” Consider the ugliness behind that commonplace phrase. The abuses of the credit industry: sudden rate increases, a ballooning mortgage, wages and tax returns garnished and taken, foreclosure and repossession; the whole gamut. It's debt bondage basically, we are slaves to Pharoah and Citibank in South Dakota. Where is the Moses or Jesus to deliver and save?
